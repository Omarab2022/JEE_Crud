# JEE_crud

This repository contains a simple Java EE (JEE) project that implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing products. It uses Servlets and JDBC for handling HTTP requests and interacting with a relational database to perform CRUD operations on product data.

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a basic CRUD web application using Java EE technologies such as Servlets and JDBC. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing the following operations on product data:

Create: Add new products to the database.
Read: Retrieve and display a list of all products.
Update: Edit and update existing product information.
Delete: Remove products from the database.
The project is designed to be a starting point for those who want to learn how to develop web applications with JEE, Servlets, and JDBC.
